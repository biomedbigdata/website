On the medical informatics side, we seek expertise to build up a medical data integration platform that enables harmonization and analysis of sensitive data while adhering to data protection requirements. On the bioinformatics side, we seek expertise to build and integrate pipelines for systematic analysis of heterogeneous experimental data ranging from 16S ribosomal RNA to complex metabolome profiles. Moreover, we seek expertise for developing and integrating state-of-the-art statistical and network analysis methods into the platform. These methods will facilitate knowledge extraction, biomarker discovery and hypothesis generation for the CRC."

We are looking for skilled PhD students and Postdocs to contribute in building a central IT platform for gut microbiome research. On the medical informatics side, we seek expertise to build up a medical data integration platform that enables harmonization and analysis of sensitive data while adhering to data protection requirements. On the bioinformatics side, we seek expertise to build and integrate pipelines for systematic analysis of heterogeneous experimental data ranging from 16S ribosomal RNA to complex metabolome profiles. Moreover, we seek expertise for developing and integrating state-of-the-art statistical and network analysis methods into the platform. These methods will facilitate knowledge extraction, biomarker discovery and hypothesis generation for the CRC.

### Project description
The gut microbiome plays a fundamental role in health and disease. CRC 1371 (Speaker Prof. Dr. Dirk Haller) focuses on the digestive tract and proposes an interdisciplinary approach to characterizing the functional relevance of microbiome signatures in the context of inflammation and cancer. Within the INF01 subproject of CRC 1371, we assemble an interdisciplinary team with expertise in medical informatics and bioinformatics to build a central IT platform for the collection and processing of human and non-human clinical, para-clinical and experimental data produced in CRC 1371. In building this platform, you will join a huge collaborative effort to assemble the most comprehensive knowledgebase of the gut microbiome and you will have a chance to bring in your own ideas to unravel the role of the microbiome in health and disease.

### Your qualifications
Candidates hold a Master degree (or equivalent) or PhD in computer science, medical informatics, bioinformatics, computational biology or biotechnology. They are open minded, active and have a good command of the English language (oral and written). The collaborative character of this project requires excellent team and communication skills as well as technical skills in software engineering and data analysis. Knowledge of Java and / or R is of advantage.
