The first MOLIT Symposium is actively promoting the dialogue of implementing personalized medicine into treatment routine. Therefore, a platform to interlink practicing physicians and IT experts is formed. This opens up possibilities to join forces between oncology and IT on problems in patient care to make solutions usable in everyday clinical practice. 

### Study Designs for Personalized Medicine

As part of the MOLIT symposium, Christian Fegeler (MOLIT, Heilbronn) and Markus List organized a workshop on study designs for personalized medicine. The current premise is that present study designs are based on large groups of patients e.g. for testing the efficacy of medication. However, personalized medicine focuses on customized therapies for one single patient. During the workshop, we discussed how we can leverage the vast potential of molecular big data beyond the limited scope of clinical studies. Concepts like virtual cohorts may pave the way towards this in the future.
