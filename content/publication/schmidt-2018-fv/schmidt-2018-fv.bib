 abstract = {International consortia such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression
(GTEx) project, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or the
International Human Epigenetics Consortium (IHEC) have produced
a wealth of genomic datasets with the goal of advancing our
understanding of cell differentiation and disease mechanisms.
However, utilizing all of these data effectively through
integrative analysis is hampered by batch effects, large cell
type heterogeneity and low replicate numbers. To study if batch
effects across datasets can be observed and adjusted for, we
analyze RNA-seq data of 215 samples from ENCODE, Roadmap,
BLUEPRINT and DEEP as well as 1336 samples from GTEx and TCGA.
While batch effects are a considerable issue, it is non-trivial
to determine if batch adjustment leads to an improvement in data
quality, especially in cases of low replicate numbers.We present
a novel method for assessing the performance of batch effect
adjustment methods on heterogeneous data. Our method borrows
information from the Cell Ontology to establish if batch
adjustment leads to a better agreement between observed pairwise
similarity and similarity of cell types inferred from the
ontology. A comparison of state-of-the art batch effect
adjustment methods suggests that batch effects in heterogeneous
datasets with low replicate numbers cannot be adequately
adjusted. Better methods need to be developed, which can be
assessed objectively in the framework presented here.Our method
