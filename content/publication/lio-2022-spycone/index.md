# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "During disease progression or organism development, alternative splicing (AS) may lead to isoform switches (IS) that demonstrate similar temporal patterns and reflect the AS co-regulation of such genes. Tools for dynamic process analysis usually neglect AS. Here we propose Spycone (https://github.com/yollct/spycone), a splicing-aware framework for time course data analysis. Spycone exploits a novel IS detection algorithm and offers downstream analysis such as network and gene set enrichment. We demonstrate the performance of Spycone using simulated and real-world data of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
