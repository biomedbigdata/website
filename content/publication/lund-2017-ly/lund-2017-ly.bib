 abstract = {Massive amounts of 16S rRNA sequencing data have been stored in
publicly accessible databases, such as GOLD, SILVA, GreenGenes
(GG), and the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP). Many of these
sequences are tagged with geo-locations. Nevertheless,
researchers currently lack a user-friendly tool to analyze
microbial distribution in a location-specific context. BioAtlas
is an interactive web application that closes this gap between
sequence databases, taxonomy profiling and geo/body-location
information. It enables users to browse taxonomically annotated
sequences across (i) the world map, (ii) human body maps and
(iii) user-defined maps. It further allows for (iv) uploading of
own sample data, which can be placed on existing maps to (v)
browse the distribution of the associated taxonomies. Finally,
BioAtlas enables users to (vi) contribute custom maps (e.g. for
plants or animals) and to map taxonomies to pre-defined map
locations. In summary, BioAtlas facilitates map-supported
browsing of public 16S rRNA sequence data and analyses of
user-provided sequences without requiring manual mapping to
taxonomies and existing databases. AVAILABILITY:
