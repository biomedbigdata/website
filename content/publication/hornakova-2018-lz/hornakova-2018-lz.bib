 abstract = {Motivation: Genome-wide measurements of paired miRNA and gene
expression data have enabled the prediction of competing
endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). It has been shown hat the sponge effect
mediated by protein-coding as well as non-coding ceRNAs can play
an important regulatory role in the cell in health and disease.
Therefore many computational methods for the computational
identification of ceRNAs have been suggested. In particular
methods based on Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) have shown
promising results. However, the currently available
implementation is slow and cannot be used to perform computations
on a large scale. Results: Here we present JAMI, a Java tool that
uses a non-parametric estimator for CMI values from gene and
miRNA expression data. We show that JAMI speeds up the
computation of ceRNA networks by a factor of âˆ¼70 compared to
currently available implementations. Further, JAMI supports
multi-threading to make use of common multi-core architectures
for further performance gain. Requirements: Java 8. Availability:
JAMI is available as open-source software from
