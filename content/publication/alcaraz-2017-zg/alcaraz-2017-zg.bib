 abstract = {Gene expression profiles have been extensively discussed as an
aid to guide the therapy by predicting disease outcome for the
patients suffering from complex diseases, such as cancer.
However, prediction models built upon single-gene (SG) features
show poor stability and performance on independent datasets.
Attempts to mitigate these drawbacks have led to the development
of network-based approaches that integrate pathway information
to produce meta-gene (MG) features. Also, MG approaches have
only dealt with the two-class problem of good versus poor
outcome prediction. Stratifying patients based on their
molecular subtypes can provide a detailed view of the disease
and lead to more personalized therapies. We propose and discuss
a novel MG approach based on de novo pathways, which for the
first time have been used as features in a multi-class setting
to predict cancer subtypes. Comprehensive evaluation in a large
cohort of breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) revealed that MGs are considerably more stable than SG
models, while also providing valuable insight into the cancer
hallmarks that drive them. In addition, when tested on an
independent benchmark non-TCGA dataset, MG features consistently
outperformed SG models. We provide an easy-to-use web service at
http://pathclass.compbio.sdu.dk where users can upload their own
gene expression datasets from breast cancer studies and obtain
the subtype predictions from all the classifiers.},
