 abstract = {Docker virtualization allows for software tools to be executed in
an isolated and controlled environment referred to as a
container. In Docker containers, dependencies are provided
exactly as intended by the developer and, consequently, they
simplify the distribution of scientific software and foster
reproducible research. The Docker paradigm is that each container
encapsulates one particular software tool. However, to analyze
complex biomedical data sets, it is often necessary to combine
several software tools into elaborate workflows. To address this
challenge, several Docker containers need to be instantiated and
properly integrated, which complicates the software deployment
process unnecessarily. Here, we demonstrate how an extension to
Docker, Docker compose, can be used to mitigate these problems by
providing a unified setup routine that deploys several tools in
an integrated fashion. We demonstrate the power of this approach
by example of a Docker compose setup for a drug target screening
platform consisting of five integrated web applications and
shared infrastructure, deployable in just two lines of codes.},
