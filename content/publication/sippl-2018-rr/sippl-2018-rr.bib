 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Standard therapeutic protocols for glioblastoma, the
most aggressive type of brain cancer, include surgery followed by
chemoradiotherapy. Additionally, carmustine-eluting wafers can be
implanted locally into the resection cavity. OBJECTIVE: To
evaluate microRNA (miRNA)-181d as a prognostic marker of
responses to carmustine wafer implantation. METHODS: A total of
80 glioblastoma patients (40/group) were included in a matched
pair analysis. One group (carmustine wafer group) received
concomitant chemoradiotherapy with carmustine wafer implantation
(Stupp protocol). The second group (control group) received only
concomitant chemoradiotherapy. All tumor specimens were subjected
to evaluations of miRNA-181d expression, results were correlated
with further individual clinical data. The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) dataset of 149 patients was used as an independent cohort
to validate the results. RESULTS: Patients in the carmustine
wafer group with low miRNA-181d expression had significantly
longer overall (hazard ratio [HR], 35.03, [95% confidence
interval (CI): 3.50-350.23], P = .002) and progression-free
survival (HR, 20.23, [95% CI: 2.19-186.86], P = .008) than
patients of the same group with a high miRNA-181d expression.
These correlations were not observed in the control group. The
nonsignificance in the control group was confirmed in the
independent TCGA dataset. The carmustine wafer group patients
with low miRNA-181d expression also had a significantly longer
progression-free (P = .049) and overall survival (OS) (P = .034),
compared with control group patients. Gross total resection
correlated significantly with longer OS (P = .023). CONCLUSION:
MiRNA-181d expression significantly affects treatment responses
to carmustine wafer implantation.},
