crucially depends on determining the correct subtype. In recent
years, gene expression profiling has been investigated as an
alternative to histochemical methods. Since databases like TCGA
provide easy and unrestricted access to gene expression data for
hundreds of patients, the challenge is to extract a minimal
optimal set of genes with good prognostic properties from a large
bulk of genes making a moderate contribution to classification.
Several studies have successfully applied machine learning
algorithms to solve this so-called gene selection problem.
However, more diverse data from other OMICS technologies are
available, including methylation. We hypothesize that combining
methylation and gene expression data could already lead to a
largely improved classification model, since the resulting model
will reflect differences not only on the transcriptomic, but also
on an epigenetic level. We compared so-called random forest
derived classification models based on gene expression and
methylation data alone, to a model based on the combined features
and to a model based on the gold standard PAM50. We obtained
bootstrap errors of 10-20% and classification error of 1-50%,
depending on breast cancer subtype and model. The gene expression
model was clearly superior to the methylation model, which was
also reflected in the combined model, which mainly selected
features from gene expression data. However, the methylation
model was able to identify unique features not considered as
relevant by the gene expression model, which might provide deeper
insights into breast cancer subtype differentiation on an
epigenetic level.},
