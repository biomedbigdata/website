 abstract = {Electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) are more accessible and
reliable than their paper based alternatives and thus find
widespread adoption. While a large number of commercial products
is available, small- to mid-sized laboratories can often not
afford the costs or are concerned about the longevity of the
providers. Turning towards free alternatives, however, raises
questions about data protection, which are not sufficiently
addressed by available solutions. To serve as legal documents,
ELNs must prevent scientific fraud through technical means such
as digital signatures. It would also be advantageous if an ELN
was integrated with a laboratory information management system to
allow for a comprehensive documentation of experimental work
including the location of samples that were used in a particular
experiment. Here, we present OpenLabNotes, which adds
state-of-the-art ELN capabilities to OpenLabFramework, a powerful
and flexible laboratory information management system. In
contrast to comparable solutions, it allows to protect the
intellectual property of its users by offering data protection
with digital signatures. OpenLabNotes effectively closes the gap
between research documentation and sample management, thus making
Open-LabFramework more attractive for laboratories that seek to
increase productivity through electronic data management.},
