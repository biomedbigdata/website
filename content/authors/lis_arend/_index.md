I’m a masters student in Bioinformatics at the Technical University of Munich and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München since October 2020. I developed a federated Cox proportional hazard model app for the FeatureCloud platform for my bachelor thesis and I am currently working on an integrated CyTOF data analysis pipeline.
