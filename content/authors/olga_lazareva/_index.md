I'm a PhD student in the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics at TU Munich. In 2015, I received a B.S. in Applied Mathematics in Moscow, and after some time in the industry, I moved to Rome to do an MSc in Data Science at La Sapienza University of Rome. I  wrote my Master's thesis in the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics on a problem of conjoint clustering of patients, networks and omics data and then stayed for my PhD. In January 2020 I have also received Fellowship from Zentrum Digitalisierung.Bayern (ZD.B) and now I am focusing on various unsupervised methods for multi-omics data integration and analysis.
