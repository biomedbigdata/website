From 2016 to 2022, I studied Bioinformatics as B.Sc. and M.Sc. in a joint program at the LMU and TUM. For my bachelor's thesis, I joined the ListLab in 2019 to look into histone modifications' impact on alternative splicing. From August 2019 until the end of 2022, I worked as a student research assistant in the group. My master's thesis within the scope of the [IHEC Integrative Analysis](https://ihec-epigenomes.org/research/integrative-analysis/) project expanded the idea of the bachelor's thesis and added DNA methylation to the epigenetic marks that were associated with alternative splicing. Since 2023 I have continued as a doctoral student/Ph.D. candidate for the [REPO4EU](https://repo4.eu/) project to build a knowledge base for drug repurposing.
