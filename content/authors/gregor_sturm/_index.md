Gregor did his Master with us in immuno-oncology. In collaboration with Pieris Pharmaceuticals in Freising and Prof. Zlatko Trajanoski's Lab in Innsbruck he aimed to better understand the functional orientation of immune cells in the tumor micro-environment. He continued as a PhD student in the Trajanoski lab in Innsbruck.
