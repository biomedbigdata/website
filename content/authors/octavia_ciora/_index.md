I am a Bioinformatics Master student at the TUM and LMU. I joined the group in 2019, when I did my bachelor thesis on the role of circular RNA in sponging and implemented a docker pipeline for analyzing matched small- and total-RNA sequencing data. 
Since September 2020, I am working on extending the circRNA analysis and implementing an nextflow pipeline as part of my advanced practical course. In October 2020, I started working as a student assistant.
