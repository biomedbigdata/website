I am a PhD student in the Big Data in Biomedicine group at TUM. I joined this group first in 2020 as a student research assistant, where I developed the R shiny app Namco, which offers multiple analysis workflows for micobiome data. I then finished my master's thesis in 2021, where I implemented an R package called SimBu, which can be used to simulate bulk RNA sequencing datasets with variable cell type composition. My current work is focused mainly on the analysis of transcriptomic and DNA methylation data in patients with viral diseases such as Hepatitis C, where we study the long-term effects of virus infections in a joint project called NetfLID together with TU Braunschweig and Medizinische Hochschule Hannover.
