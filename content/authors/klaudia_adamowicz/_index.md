I am a master student of bioinformatics at TUM and LMU. After joining the Institute of Computational Biology (ICB) at Helmholtz Zentrum München, where I worked on single cell RNA seq analysis during my master internship, I extended my collaboration to work on a machine learning project with tensorflow 2. For my master thesis I joined the ListLab, where I am now working on node centrality measures for disease module identification to create new algorithms for use in drug repurposing.
