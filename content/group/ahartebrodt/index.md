I am a master student in Bioinformatics at TUM and LMU in Munich and recently joined the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics to work on my Master’s thesis. My aim is to provide an additional functionality to KeyPathwayMiner, the lab’s network enrichment tool, by implementing a p-value based approach. Previously, I have worked with omics and health care data.
