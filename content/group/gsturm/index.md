I am a master student in Bioinformatics with a research interest in Epigenetics and Immuno-Oncology. In my master thesis I am collaborating with Pieris Pharmaceuticals in Freising and Prof. Zlatko Trajanoski's Lab in Innsbruck to better understand the functional orientation of immune cells in the tumor micro-environment. In a previous project, I co-developed BioQC, a method for assessing gene expression data for tissue heterogeneity.
