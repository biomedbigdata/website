I'm a Bachelor student in Bioinformatics at the Technical University of Munich and the LMU since 2017. I'm working at the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics in Weihenstephan as a HiWi. In my current project I implement new features into the web version of KeyPathwayMiner, with the goal to make it more efficient and user-friendly as well as to implement new features suggested by the community.
