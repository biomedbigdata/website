# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "While large amounts of epigenomic data are publicly available, their retrieval in a form suitable for downstream analysis is a bottleneck in current research. In a typical analysis, users are required to download huge files that span the entire genome, even if they are only interested in a small subset (e.g. promoter regions) or an aggregation thereof. Moreover, complex operations on genome-level data are not always feasible on a local computer due to resource limitations.<br/><br/>We present the DeepBlue Epigenomic Data Server which mitigates this issue by providing a powerful interface and API for filtering, transforming, aggregating and downloading multi-scale data from several epigenomic consortia, making it the ideal resource for bioinformaticians that seek to integrate up-to-date epigenomics resources into their workflow. Furthermore, we present an R/Bioconductor package that enables users not proficient in scripting or programming languages to analyze epigenomic data in a user-friendly way. Here, the extracted data are automatically converted to suitable R data structures for downstream analysis and visualization within the Bioconductor framework.<br/><br/> DeepBlue was well received by the International Human Epigenome Consortium and already attracted much attention by the epigenomic research community with currently 90 registered users and more than a million anonymous data requests since the release in 2015. The web interface and the API documentation, including usage examples and use cases, are available at http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/. The DeepBlueR package is available at http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/R"
