While several protocols are available to investigate leukocyte expression, platelet staining and analysis with CyTOF have been described only from whole blood. Moreover, available protocols do not allow sample storage but require fresh samples to be obtained, processed, and measured immediately. We provide a structured and reproducible method to stain platelets from platelet-rich plasma to study thrombocyte protein expression and reactivity using mass cytometry. With our method, it is possible to acquire a large number of events allowing deep bioinformatic investigation of platelet expression heterogeneity. Integrated in our protocol is also a previously established freezing protocol that allows the storage of stained samples and to delay their measurement. Finally, we provide a structured workflow using different platelet stimulators and a freely available bioinformatic pipeline to analyze platelet expression. Our protocol unlocks the potential of CyTOF analysis for studying platelet biology in health and disease.","tags":[],"title":"Mass cytometry of platelet-rich plasma: a new approach to analyze platelet surface expression and reactivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Dietrich","Monica Matchado","Maximilian Zwiebel","Benjamin Ölke","Michael Lauber","Ilias Lagkouvardos","Jan Baumbach","Dirk Haller","Beate Brandl","Thoams Skurk","Hans Hauner","Sandra Reitmeier","Markus List"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639609200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639609200,"objectID":"84a0bd6114e1341765279fdc9737d44d","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/matchado-2021-namco/","publishdate":"2021-12-16T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/matchado-2021-namco/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: 16S rRNA gene profiling is currently the most widely used technique in microbiome research and allows for studying microbial diversity, taxonomic profiling, phylogenetics, functional and network analysis. While a plethora of tools have been developed for the analysis of 16S rRNA gene data, only few platforms offer a user-friendly interface and none comprehensively cover the whole analysis pipeline from raw data processing down to complex analysis. Results: We introduce Namco, an R shiny application that offers a streamlined interface and serves as a one-stop solution for microbiome analysis. We demonstrate Namco's capabilities by studying the association between rich fibre diet and the gut microbiota composition. Namco helped to prove the hypothesis that butyrate-producing bacteria are prompted by fibre-enriched intervention. Conclusion: Namco provides a broad range of features from raw data processing and basic statistics down to machine learning and network analysis, thus covering complex data analysis tasks that are not comprehensively covered elsewhere.

While low quality, reproducibility issues, and translational irrelevance of most basic and preclinical research have contributed to this, the current organ-centricity of medicine and the ‘one disease–one target–one drug’ dogma obstruct innovation in the most profound manner. Systems and network medicine and their therapeutic arm, network pharmacology, revolutionize how we define, diagnose, treat, and, ideally, cure diseases. Descriptive disease phenotypes are replaced by endotypes defined by causal, multitarget signaling modules that also explain respective comorbidities. Precise and effective therapeutic intervention is achieved by synergistic multicompound network pharmacology and drug repurposing, obviating the need for drug discovery and speeding up clinical translation.","tags":[],"title":"Network pharmacology: curing causal mechanisms instead of treating symptoms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zakaria Louadi","Maria L Elkjaer","Chit Tong Lio","Amit Fenn","Zsolt Illes","Dario Bongiovanni","Jan Baumbach","Tim Kacprowski","Markus List","Olga Tsoy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638399600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638399600,"objectID":"332fd85906700a858c10ef51898966c1","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/louadi-2021-nease/","publishdate":"2021-12-02T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/louadi-2021-nease/","section":"publication","summary":"Alternative splicing (AS) is an important aspect of gene regulation. Nevertheless, its role in molecular processes and pathobiology is far from understood. A roadblock is that tools for the functional analysis of AS-set events are lacking. To mitigate this, we developed NEASE, a tool integrating pathways with structural annotations of protein-protein interactions to functionally characterize AS events. We show in four application cases how NEASE can identify pathways contributing to tissue identity and cell type development, and how it highlights splicing-related biomarkers. With a unique view on AS, NEASE generates unique and meaningful biological insights complementary to classical pathways analysis.","tags":[],"title":"Functional enrichment of alternative splicing events with NEASE reveals insights into tissue identity and diseases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lis Arend","Judith Bernett","Quirin Manz","Melissa Klug","Olga Lazareva","Jan Baumbach","Dario Bongiovanni","Markus List"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638226800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638226800,"objectID":"dac8e1e18a124e167a54b16bdda7a573","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/arend-2021-cyanus/","publishdate":"2021-11-30T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/arend-2021-cyanus/","section":"publication","summary":"Cytometry techniques are widely used to discover cellular characteristics at single-cell resolution. Many data analysis methods for cytometry data focus solely on identifying subpopulations via clustering and testing for differential cell abundance. For differential expression analysis of markers between conditions, only few tools exist. These tools either reduce the data distribution to medians, discarding valuable information, or have underlying assumptions that may not hold for all expression patterns. Here, we systematically evaluated existing and novel approaches for differential expression analysis on real and simulated CyTOF data. We found that methods using median marker expressions compute fast and reliable results when the data are not strongly zero-inflated. Methods using all data detect changes in strongly zero-inflated markers, but partially suffer from overprediction or cannot handle big datasets. We present a new method, CyEMD, based on calculating the earth mover’s distance between expression distributions that can handle strong zero-inflation without being too sensitive.

Previous efforts have identified many underlying factors, such as batch effects and incorrect sample annotations. Recently, tissue heterogeneity, a consequence of unintended profiling of cells of other origins than the tissue of interest, was proposed as a source of variance that exacerbates irreproducibility and is commonly ignored. Results: Here, we systematically analyzed 2,692 publicly available gene expression datasets including 78,332 samples for tissue heterogeneity. We found a prevalence of tissue heterogeneity in gene expression data that affects on average 5-15% of the samples, depending on the tissue type. We distinguish cases of severe heterogeneity, which may be caused by mistakes in annotation or sample handling, from cases of moderate heterogeneity, which are more likely caused by tissue infiltration or sample contamination. Conclusions: Tissue heterogeneity is a widespread issue in publicly available gene expression datasets and thus an important source of variance that should not be ignored. We advocate the application of quality control methods such as BioQC to detect tissue heterogeneity prior to mining or analysing gene expression data.","tags":[],"title":"Tissue heterogeneity is prevalent in gene expression studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julian Matschinske","Nicolas Alcaraz","Arriel Benis","Martin Golebiewski","Dominik G.

Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccines induce spike protein overexpression to trigger SARS-CoV-2-specific immune protection, thrombocyte activity has not been investigated in this context. Here, we provide the first phenotypic platelet characterization of healthy human subjects undergoing BNT162b2 vaccination. Using mass cytometry, we analyzed the expression of constitutive transmembrane receptors, adhesion proteins, and platelet activation markers in 12 healthy donors before and at five different time points within 4 weeks after the first BNT162b2 administration. We measured platelet reactivity by stimulating thrombocyte activation with thrombin receptor-activating peptide. Activation marker expression (P-selectin, LAMP-3, LAMP-1, CD40L, and PAC-1) did not change after vaccination. All investigated constitutive transmembrane proteins showed similar expressions over time. Platelet reactivity was not altered after BNT162b2 administration. Activation marker expression was significantly lower compared with an independent cohort of mild symptomatic COVID-19 patients analyzed with the same platform.

To this end, AMIMs combine network analysis algorithms with molecular profiling data, most commonly, by projecting gene expression data onto generic protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. Although active module identification has led to various novel insights into complex diseases, there is increasing awareness in the field that the combination of gene expression data and PPI network is problematic because up-to-date PPI networks have a very small diameter and are subject to both technical and literature bias. In this paper, we report the results of an extensive study where we analyzed for the first time whether widely used AMIMs really benefit from using PPI networks. Our results clearly show that, except for the recently proposed AMIM DOMINO, the tested AMIMs do not produce biologically more meaningful candidate disease modules on widely used PPI networks than on random networks with the same node degrees. AMIMs hence mainly learn from the node degrees and mostly fail to exploit the biological knowledge encoded in the edges of the PPI networks. This has far-reaching consequences for the field of active module identification. In particular, we suggest that novel algorithms are needed which overcome the degree bias of most existing AMIMs and/or work with customized, context-specific networks instead of generic PPI networks.","tags":[],"title":"On the limits of active module identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Scherer","Florian Schmidt","Olga Lazareva","Jörn Walter","Jan Baumbach","Marcel H Schulz","Markus List"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1615762800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615762800,"objectID":"0343f0daac553a9aae9851b20137fbfd","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/scherer-2021-machine-learning/","publishdate":"2021-03-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/scherer-2021-machine-learning/","section":"publication","summary":"Epigenetics studies inheritable and reversible modifications of DNA that allow cells to control gene expression throughout their development and in response to environmental conditions.

However, comparative studies on differences in procedures are scarce. We sequenced human stool samples and mock communities with increasing complexity using a variety of commonly used protocols. Short amplicons targeting different variable regions (V-regions) or ranges thereof (V1-V2, V1-V3, V3-V4, V4, V4-V5, V6-V8, and V7-V9) were investigated for differences in the composition outcome due to primer choices. Next, the influence of clustering (operational taxonomic units [OTUs], zero-radius OTUs [zOTUs], and amplicon sequence variants [ASVs]), different databases (GreenGenes, the Ribosomal Database Project, Silva, the genomic-based 16S rRNA Database, and The All-Species Living Tree), and bioinformatic settings on taxonomic assignment were also investigated. We present a systematic comparison across all typically used V-regions using well-established primers. While it is known that the primer choice has a significant influence on the resulting microbial composition, we show that microbial profiles generated using different primer pairs need independent validation of performance. Further, comparing data sets across V-regions using different databases might be misleading due to differences in nomenclature (e.g., Enterorhabdus versus Adlercreutzia) and varying precisions in classification down to genus level. Overall, specific but important taxa are not picked up by certain primer pairs (e.g., Bacteroidetes is missed using primers 515F-944R) or due to the database used (e.g., Acetatifactor in GreenGenes and the genomic-based 16S rRNA Database). We found that appropriate truncation of amplicons is essential and different truncated-length combinations should be tested for each study. Finally, specific mock communities of sufficient and adequate complexity are highly recommended.IMPORTANCE In 16S rRNA gene sequencing, certain bacterial genera were found to be underrepresented or even missing in taxonomic profiles when using unsuitable primer combinations, outdated reference databases, or inadequate pipeline settings. Concerning the last, quality thresholds as well as bioinformatic settings (i.e., clustering approach, analysis pipeline, and specific adjustments such as truncation) are responsible for a number of observed differences between studies. Conclusions drawn by comparing one data set to another (e.g., between publications) appear to be problematic and require independent cross-validation using matching V-regions and uniform data processing. Therefore, we highlight the importance of a thought-out study design including sufficiently complex mock standards and appropriate V-region choice for the sample of interest. The use of processing pipelines and parameters must be tested beforehand.","tags":[],"title":"Primer, Pipelines, Parameters: Issues in 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus Hoffmann","Elisabeth Pachl","Michael Hartung","Veronika Stiegler","Jan Baumbach","Marcel H Schulz","Markus List"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609887600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609887600,"objectID":"1ed7883e39d401f463bd3c158652c24f","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/hoffmann-2021-spongedb/","publishdate":"2021-01-06T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hoffmann-2021-spongedb/","section":"publication","summary":"microRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators involved in many biological processes and human diseases, including cancer.

With this study, we aimed to investigate the activation state and the expression of transmembrane proteins in platelets of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We investigated transmembrane proteins expression with a customized mass cytometry panel of 21 antibodies. Platelets of 8 hospitalized COVID-19 patients not requiring intensive care support and without pre-existing conditions were compared to platelets of healthy controls (11 donors) with and without in vitro stimulation with thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP). Mass cytometry of non-stimulated platelets detected an increased surface expression of activation markers P-Selectin (0.67 vs. 1.87 median signal intensity for controls vs. patients, p = 0.0015) and LAMP-3 (CD63, 0.37 vs. 0.81, p = 0.0004), the GPIIb/IIIa complex (4.58 vs. 5.03, p \u0026#60; 0.0001) and other adhesion molecules involved in platelet activation and platelet–leukocyte interactions. Upon TRAP stimulation, mass cytometry detected a higher expression of P-selectin in COVID-19 samples compared to controls (p \u0026#60;0.0001). However, we observed a significantly reduced capacity of COVID-19 platelets to increase the expression of activation markers LAMP-3 and P-Selectin upon stimulation with TRAP.

Thus, clustering and biclustering are powerful techniques often used with expression data, but are usually not suitable to unravel molecular mechanisms along with patient subgroups. To alleviate this, we developed the network-constrained biclustering approach BiCoN (Biclustering Constrained by Networks) which (i) restricts biclusters to functionally related genes connected in molecular interaction networks and (ii) maximizes the difference in gene expression between two subgroups of patients.\n\n**Results** Our analyses of non-small cell lung and breast cancer gene expression data demonstrate that BiCoN clusters patients in agreement with known cancer subtypes while discovering gene subnetworks pointing to functional differences between these subtypes. Furthermore, we show that BiCoN is robust to noise and batch effects and can distinguish between high and low load of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes while identifying subnetworks related to immune cell function. In summary, BiCoN is a powerful new systems medicine tool to stratify patients while elucidating the responsible disease mechanism.","tags":["cell-type heterogeneity","patient stratification","systems medicine","network enrichment"],"title":"BiCoN: Network-constrained biclustering of patients and omics data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Blumenthal","Jan Baumbach","Markus Hoffmann","Tim Kacprowski","Markus List"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606690800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606690800,"objectID":"bbf06de4065026837eb896aaa0a937f6","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/blumenthal-2020-genepiseeker/","publishdate":"2020-11-30T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/blumenthal-2020-genepiseeker/","section":"publication","summary":"Recently, various tools for detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in epistasis have been developed. However, no studies evaluate the employed statistical epistasis models such as the χ2-test or quadratic regression independently of the tools that use them. Such an independent evaluation is crucial for developing improved epistasis detection tools, for it allows to decide if a tool’s performance should be attributed to the epistasis model or to the optimization strategy run on top of it.We present a protocol for evaluating epistasis models independently of the tools they are used in and generalize existing models designed for dichotomous phenotypes to the categorical and quantitative case. Additionally, we propose a new model which scores candidate SNP sets by computing maximum likelihood distributions for the observed phenotypes in the cells of their penetrance tables. Extensive experiments show that the proposed maximum likelihood model outperforms three widely used epistasis models in most cases. The experiments also provide valuable insights into the properties of existing models, for instance, that quadratic regression perform particularly well on instances with quantitative phenotypes.The evaluation protocol and all compared models are implemented in C ++ and are supported under Linux and macOS. They are available at https://github.com/baumbachlab/genepiseeker/, along with test datasets and scripts to reproduce the experiments.

Federated averaging (FedAvg) is a well-known communication-efficient algorithm for federated learning, which performs well if the data distribution across the clients is independently and identically distributed (IID). However, FedAvg provides a lower accuracy and still requires a large number of communication rounds to achieve a target accuracy when it comes to Non-IID environments. To address the former limitation, we present federated single mini-batch (FedSMB), where the clients train the model on a single mini-batch from their dataset in each iteration. We show that FedSMB achieves the accuracy of the centralized training in Non-IID configurations, but in a considerable number of iterations. To address the latter limitation, we introduce federated multi-mini-batch (FedMMB) as a generalization of FedSMB, where the clients train the model on multiple mini-batches (specified by the batch count) in each communication round. FedMMB decouples the batch size from the batch count and provides a trade-off between the accuracy and communication efficiency in Non-IID settings. This is not possible with FedAvg, in which a single parameter determines both the batch size and batch count. The simulation results illustrate that FedMMB outperforms FedAvg in terms of the accuracy, communication efficiency, as well as computational efficiency and is an efficient training approach to federated learning in Non-IID environments.","tags":["federated"],"title":"Federated Multi-Mini-Batch: An Efficient Training Approach to Federated Learning in Non-IID Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Franziska Hufsky","Kevin Lamkiewicz","Alexandre Almeida","Abdel Aouacheria","Cecilia Arighi","Alex Bateman","Jan Baumbach","Niko Beerenwinkel","Christian Brandt","Marco Cacciabue","others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604444400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604444400,"objectID":"efdd2cd03a70e7b5659c03964eda3c2c","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/hufsky-2020-computational/","publishdate":"2020-11-04T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hufsky-2020-computational/","section":"publication","summary":"SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel virus of the family Coronaviridae.

This review includes an introduction to the principles of several widely used mechanistic modeling methods, focusing on their areas of applicability as well as their limitations. A potential complementary role of machine-learning methods in the development of mechanistic models is also discussed. The descriptions of the methods also include links to corresponding modeling software tools as well as practical examples of their application. Finally, we also explicitly address different aspects of multiscale modeling approaches that allow a more complete and holistic perspective of the human body.","tags":["systems medicine","network analysis"],"title":"Mechanistic Modeling and Multiscale Applications for Precision Medicine: Theory and Practice","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"To address the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) crisis, drug repurposing is an attractive approach that offers new therapeutic options through the identification of alternative usages for already approved drugs. Numerous research groups around the world are working on treatment options for COVID-19 and are joining efforts to identify drugs that can be repurposed. A promising strategy for identifying drugs is to use network and systems medicine approaches, which provide a comprehensive understanding of the infection mechanisms while not only focussing on the virus and its direct interaction partners, but also including the host protein interaction network. To aid in COVID-19 related drug repurposing, the Chair of Experimental Bioinformatics organized a hackathon to develop CoVex, a network and systems medicine platform that integrates virus-human interaction data for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. CoVex supports researchers in interactive network medicine analysis, where they can bring in their expert knowledge to identify putative drug targets and drug repurposing candidates.\nMore information: https://www.exbio.de/exbio-vs-covid-part-1 The CoVex platform: https://exbio.wzw.tum.de/covex Animation video:\n ","date":1587679200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587679200,"objectID":"83ed04186bba6d0c1ec27a3f5acf1a8e","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/post/covex/","publishdate":"2020-04-24T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/covex/","section":"post","summary":"The CoVex systems medicine platform allows identifying putative drug targets and drug repurposing candidates to treat COVID-19.","tags":["COVID-19","Sars-CoV-2","hackathon","systems medicine","network medicine","drug repurposing"],"title":"The fight against COVID-19","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1587404398,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587404398,"objectID":"594d7e141fed9676725f5f1308fb4973","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/tool/covex/","publishdate":"2020-04-20T19:39:58+02:00","relpermalink":"/tool/covex/","section":"tool","summary":"Drug repurposing on the Sars-CoV2 virus-host-drug interactome.","tags":["systems medicine","drug repurposing","network analysis"],"title":"CoVex","type":"tool"},{"authors":["Quirin Manz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585692000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585692000,"objectID":"43e2a8c7f693fe83cac7fec6c84c8dcc","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/tool/asimulator/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/tool/asimulator/","section":"tool","summary":"A simulator for RNA-seq data with alternative splicing events written in R.","tags":["Sys_CARE"],"title":"ASimulatoR","type":"tool"},{"authors":["Julia Mergner","Martin Frejno","Markus List","Michael Papacek","Xia Chen","Ajeet Chaudhary","Patroklos Samaras","Sandra Richter","Hiromasa Shikata","Maxim Messerer","others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583881200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583881200,"objectID":"7314533d9c8c286e8462f806c40c58c0","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/mergner-2020-mass/","publishdate":"2020-03-11T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mergner-2020-mass/","section":"publication","summary":"Plants are essential for life and are extremely diverse organisms with unique molecular capabilities1.

Most studies are limited to the average DNA methylation levels of individual CpGs and thus neglect heterogeneity within the profiled cell populations. To assess this within-sample heterogeneity (WSH) several window-based scores that quantify variability in DNA methylation in sequencing reads have been proposed. We performed the first systematic comparison of four published WSH scores based on simulated and publicly available datasets. Moreover, we propose two new scores and provide guidelines for selecting appropriate scores to address cell-type heterogeneity, cellular contamination and allele-specific methylation. Most of the measures were sensitive in detecting DNA methylation heterogeneity in these scenarios, while we detected differences in susceptibility to technical bias. Using recently published DNA methylation profiles of Ewing sarcoma samples, we show that DNA methylation heterogeneity provides information complementary to the DNA methylation level. WSH scores are powerful tools for estimating variance in DNA methylation patterns and have the potential for detecting novel disease-associated genomic loci not captured by established statistics. We provide an R-package implementing the WSH scores for integration into analysis workflows.","tags":["cell-type deconvolution","tumor microenvironment","DNA methylation","cell type heterogeneity"],"title":"Quantitative comparison of within-sample heterogeneity scores for DNA methylation data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Olga Lazareva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577554798,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577554798,"objectID":"ef754c6f89ddaf5f48615e2e590721c1","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/tool/bicon/","publishdate":"2019-12-28T19:39:58+02:00","relpermalink":"/tool/bicon/","section":"tool","summary":"Network-constrained biclustering for patient stratification.","tags":["patient stratification","network analysis","biclustering","mechanotyping","systems medicine"],"title":"BiCoN","type":"tool"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577554798,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577554798,"objectID":"a56fbc9a303608711041a499e5051591","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/tool/wsh/","publishdate":"2019-12-28T19:39:58+02:00","relpermalink":"/tool/wsh/","section":"tool","summary":"Computing within-sample heterogeneity scores from bisulfte sequencing data.","tags":["cell type heterogeneity"],"title":"WSH","type":"tool"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577554798,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577554798,"objectID":"b5ae991f031ebb2c39ecb1752cd4c2a1","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/tool/immunedeconv/","publishdate":"2019-12-28T19:39:58+02:00","relpermalink":"/tool/immunedeconv/","section":"tool","summary":"A unifying package for in silico cell type deconvolution in immuno-oncology.","tags":["cell type heterogeneity","systems medicine"],"title":"immunedeconv","type":"tool"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576159200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576159200,"objectID":"d12361088859b46489aed65cc8635a21","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/talk/qbic2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-12T16:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/qbic2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Large amounts of epigenomic data are publicly available, yet their retrieval for downstream analysis is a research bottleneck. Typically, users download huge files that span the entire genome, even if they are only interested in a small subset (e.g. promoter regions) or an aggregation thereof. Moreover, complex operations on genome-level data are not always feasible on a local computer due to resource limitations.The DeepBlue Epigenomic Data Server (http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) mitigates this issue by providing a powerful interface and API for filtering, transforming, aggregating and downloading multi-scale data from several epigenomic consortia, making it the ideal resource for integrating epigenomics resources into analysis workflows and tools.While any programming language can be used to access the DeepBlue API, we developed an R/Bioconductor package (https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.DeepBlueR) that enables users not proficient in scripting or programming languages to analyze epigenomic data in a user-friendly way. Here, the extracted data are automatically converted to suitable R data structures for downstream analysis and visualization within the Bioconductor framework.In the second part of my talk, I will highlight our recent work on DNA methylation heterogeneity on bulk bisulfite sequencing data. Notably, most studies of DNA methylation focus almost exclusively on mapping differences in average methylation, neglecting the contribution of cell-to-cell variability. While various scores have been proposed to capture DNA methylation heterogeneity, we performed the first systematic comparison of existing scores on both simulated and experimental data. In our benchmark, we consider different scenarios from which heterogeneity can arise, including cell-type heterogeneity and allele-specific methylation, and propose two new scores that accurately capture DNA methylation heterogeneity and are the first to cover individual CpGs.","tags":["epigenomics","bioconductor"],"title":"Analysing large-scale epigenomic data","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Tarek Kröhler","Sonja M.

Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining or single-cell sequencing are often unavailable such that we rely on computational methods to estimate the immune-cell composition from bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Various methods have been proposed recently, yet their capabilities and limitations have not been evaluated systematically. A general guideline leading the research community through cell type deconvolution is missing.*Results*We developed a systematic approach for benchmarking such computational methods and assessed the accuracy of tools at estimating nine different immune- and stromal cells from bulk RNA-seq samples. We used a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of ∼11 000 cells from the TME to simulate bulk samples of known cell type proportions, and validated the results using independent, publicly available gold-standard estimates. This allowed us to analyze and condense the results of more than a hundred thousand predictions to provide an exhaustive evaluation across seven computational methods over nine cell types and ∼1800 samples from five simulated and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that computational deconvolution performs at high accuracy for well-defined cell-type signatures and propose how fuzzy cell-type signatures can be improved. We suggest that future efforts should be dedicated to refining cell population definitions and finding reliable signatures.*Availability and implementation*A snakemake pipeline to reproduce the benchmark is available at https://github.com/grst/immune_deconvolution_benchmark.

Individual miRNAs may regulate hundreds of genes, giving rise to a complex gene regulatory network in which transcripts carrying miRNA binding sites act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). Several methods for the analysis of ceRNA interactions exist, but these do often not adjust for statistical confounders or address the problem that more than one miRNA interacts with a target transcript.*Results* We present SPONGE, a method for the fast construction of ceRNA networks. SPONGE uses ’multiple sensitivity correlation’, a newly defined measure for which we can estimate a distribution under a null hypothesis. SPONGE can accurately quantify the contribution of multiple miRNAs to a ceRNA interaction with a probabilistic model that addresses previously neglected confounding factors and allows fast P-value calculation, thus outperforming existing approaches. We applied SPONGE to paired miRNA and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas for studying global effects of miRNA-mediated cross-talk. Our results highlight already established and novel protein-coding and non-coding ceRNAs which could serve as biomarkers in cancer.*Availability and implementation*SPONGE is available as an R/Bioconductor package (doi: 10.18129/B9.bioc.SPONGE).","tags":["miRNA regulatoin","competing endogeneous RNA","gene regulation","systems biology"],"title":"Large-scale inference of competing endogenous RNA networks with sparse partial correlation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Sippl","Ralf Ketter","Lisa Bohr","Yoo Jin Kim","Markus List","Joachim Oertel","Steffi Urbschat"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546297200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546297200,"objectID":"f12c7d0e46ff375fa5323949f6d2b070","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/sippl-2019-mirna/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/sippl-2019-mirna/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"MiRNA-181d expression significantly affects treatment responses to carmustine wafer implantation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sonja Kessler","Kevan Hosseini","Tarek Kroehler","Ahmad Barghash","Sonika Patial","Jessica Hoppstaedter","Katja Gemperlein","Johannes Haybaeck","Markus List","Rolf Mueller"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546297200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546297200,"objectID":"bea8958954b91705b9a558630eed349a","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/kessler-2019-thu/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/kessler-2019-thu/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"THU-470-The mRNA-binding protein tristetraprolin promotes hepatocarcinogenesis but inhibits tumour progression in liver cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546018798,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546018798,"objectID":"4f28afcfb89f569a94be0d406eb7e000","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/tool/keypathwayminer/","publishdate":"2018-12-28T19:39:58+02:00","relpermalink":"/tool/keypathwayminer/","section":"tool","summary":"*de novo* network enrichment to integrate multi-omics data with the interactome.","tags":["network analysis","systems medicine"],"title":"KPM","type":"tool"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544099400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544099400,"objectID":"77dc0160beae851647e9f4659a4f7e77","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/talk/bioc2018/","publishdate":"2018-12-06T14:30:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/bioc2018/","section":"talk","summary":"While large amounts of epigenomic data are publicly available, their retrieval in a form suitable for downstream analysis is a bottleneck in current research.

Moreover, complex operations on genome-level data are not always feasible on a local computer due to resource limitations.We present the DeepBlue Epigenomic Data Server which mitigates this issue by providing a powerful interface and API for filtering, transforming, aggregating and downloading multi-scale data from several epigenomic consortia, making it the ideal resource for bioinformaticians that seek to integrate up-to-date epigenomics resources into their workflow. Furthermore, we present an R/Bioconductor package that enables users not proficient in scripting or programming languages to analyze epigenomic data in a user-friendly way. Here, the extracted data are automatically converted to suitable R data structures for downstream analysis and visualization within the Bioconductor framework. DeepBlue was well received by the International Human Epigenome Consortium and already attracted much attention by the epigenomic research community with currently 90 registered users and more than a million anonymous data requests since the release in 2015.

This poses a powerful disease mechanism that disrupts parts of the cellular transcriptional program through one or few key sponge genes. In particular in cancer, non-coding RNAs may facilitate changes in transcriptional programs without the risk of lethal side effects caused by expressing a protein at abnormally high or low levels. In spite of the importance of this phenomenon, we currently lack an efficient method for inferring sponge interactions on a genome-wide scale. Moreover, confounding factors such as large differences in sample numbers prevent comparisons across different cancer cohorts. This motivated us to develop sparse partial correlation on gene expression (SPONGE), a method that is orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches and allows for the construction of genome-wide ceRNA interaction networks. SPONGE is the first method to compute empirical p-values efficiently based on a series of null models and can thus control for confounding factors that were underestimated in previous studies. SPONGE enabled us to build the most comprehensive set of genome-wide ceRNA regulation models for 22 cancer types based on miRNA and gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Since SPONGE accounts for confounding factors, we could perform pan-cancer analyses and reveal hundreds of novel sponge genes. In particular non-coding genes appear suitable as survival markers in different cancer types.

Also, MG approaches haveonly dealt with the two-class problem of good versus pooroutcome prediction. Stratifying patients based on theirmolecular subtypes can provide a detailed view of the diseaseand lead to more personalized therapies. We propose and discussa novel MG approach based on de novo pathways, which for thefirst time have been used as features in a multi-class settingto predict cancer subtypes. Comprehensive evaluation in a largecohort of breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas(TCGA) revealed that MGs are considerably more stable than SGmodels, while also providing valuable insight into the cancerhallmarks that drive them. In addition, when tested on anindependent benchmark non-TCGA dataset, MG features consistentlyoutperformed SG models. We provide an easy-to-use web service athttp://pathclass.compbio.sdu.dk where users can upload their owngene expression datasets from breast cancer studies and obtainthe subtype predictions from all the classifiers.","tags":["de novo network enrichment","systems biology","multi-omics network analysis","cancer subtyping"],"title":"De novo pathway-based biomarker identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus List"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496268000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496268000,"objectID":"f9947b9648ca7fdf2daa0a3766c1be34","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/list-2017-using/","publishdate":"2017-06-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/list-2017-using/","section":"publication","summary":"Docker virtualization allows for software tools to be executed inan isolated and controlled environment referred to as acontainer. In Docker containers, dependencies are providedexactly as intended by the developer and, consequently, theysimplify the distribution of scientific software and fosterreproducible research. The Docker paradigm is that each containerencapsulates one particular software tool. However, to analyzecomplex biomedical data sets, it is often necessary to combineseveral software tools into elaborate workflows. To address thischallenge, several Docker containers need to be instantiated andproperly integrated, which complicates the software deploymentprocess unnecessarily. Here, we demonstrate how an extension toDocker, Docker compose, can be used to mitigate these problems byproviding a unified setup routine that deploys several tools inan integrated fashion. We demonstrate the power of this approachby example of a Docker compose setup for a drug target screeningplatform consisting of five integrated web applications andshared infrastructure, deployable in just two lines of codes.","tags":["docker","high-throughput screening","LIMS","scalability","containerization","web application"],"title":"Using Docker Compose for the Simple Deployment of an Integrated Drug Target Screening Platform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephanie Wittig-Blaich","Rainer Wittig","Steffen Schmidt","Stefan Lyer","Melanie Bewerunge-Hudler","Sabine Gronert-Sum","Olga Strobel-Freidekind","Carolin Müller","Markus List","Aleksandra Jaskot","Helle Christiansen","Mathias Hafner","Dirk Schadendorf","Ines Block","Jan Mollenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488322800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488322800,"objectID":"8b6c3a2c18ef983dc0c32d7811e779d4","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/wittig-2017-systematic/","publishdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/wittig-2017-systematic/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["functional genomics","cancer","synthetic lethality"],"title":"Systematic screening of isogenic cancer cells identifies DUSP6 as context-specific synthetic lethal target in melanoma","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felipe Albrecht","Markus List","Christoph Bock","Thomas Lengauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483225200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483225200,"objectID":"22f390048e924e9d456e592c4f905622","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/albrecht-2017-deepbluer/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/albrecht-2017-deepbluer/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["epigenomics","IHEC","R","bioconductor"],"title":"DeepBlueR: large-scale epigenomic analysis in R","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Richa Batra","Nicolas Alcaraz","Kevin Gitzhofer","Josch K.

laboratory notebooks (ELNs) are more accessible andreliable than their paper based alternatives and thus findwidespread adoption. While a large number of commercial productsis available, small- to mid-sized laboratories can often notafford the costs or are concerned about the longevity of theproviders. Turning towards free alternatives, however, raisesquestions about data protection, which are not sufficientlyaddressed by available solutions. To serve as legal documents,ELNs must prevent scientific fraud through technical means suchas digital signatures. It would also be advantageous if an ELNwas integrated with a laboratory information management system toallow for a comprehensive documentation of experimental workincluding the location of samples that were used in a particularexperiment. Here, we present OpenLabNotes, which addsstate-of-the-art ELN capabilities to OpenLabFramework, a powerfuland flexible laboratory information management system. Incontrast to comparable solutions, it allows to protect theintellectual property of its users by offering data protectionwith digital signatures. OpenLabNotes effectively closes the gapbetween research documentation and sample management, thus makingOpen-LabFramework more attractive for laboratories that seek toincrease productivity through electronic data management.","tags":["functional genomics","LIMS","electronic laboratory notebook","web application"],"title":"OpenLabNotes - An Electronic Laboratory Notebook Extension for OpenLabFramework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlene Lemvig Pedersen","Ines Block","Markus List","Helle Christiansen","Steffen Schmidt","Jan Mollenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420066800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420066800,"objectID":"53c3457d5163cba8538cea56638520e9","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/pedersen-2015-reverse/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pedersen-2015-reverse/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reverse Phase Protein Arrays for High-throughput Toxicity Screening","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus List","Ines Block","Marlene Lemvig Pedersen","Helle Christiansen","Steffen Schmidt","Mads Thomassen","Qihua Tan","Jan Baumbach","Jan Mollenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1406844000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1406844000,"objectID":"afb0a3510f20f78a4708f2bdd0a587a8","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/list-2014-microarray/","publishdate":"2014-08-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/list-2014-microarray/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["LIMS","protein array","functional genomics","high-throughput screening","web application"],"title":"Microarray R-based analysis of complex lysate experiments with MIRACLE","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus List","Steffen Schmidt","Jakub Trojnar","Jochen Thomas","Mads Thomassen","Torben A Kruse","Qihua Tan","Jan Baumbach","Jan Mollenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1393628400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393628400,"objectID":"cd5128493ec3b0348deb023bfeb20ccc","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/list-2014-efficient/","publishdate":"2014-03-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/list-2014-efficient/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["LIMS","functional genomics","web application"],"title":"Efficient Sample Tracking With OpenLabFramework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus List","Anne-Christin Hauschild","Qihua Tan","Torben A Kruse","Jan Mollenhauer","Jan Baumbach","Richa Batra"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"d3b35476a4dbe27c354badb376acb14e","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/list-2014-classification/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/list-2014-classification/","section":"publication","summary":"Selecting the most promising treatment strategy for breast cancercrucially depends on determining the correct subtype. In recentyears, gene expression profiling has been investigated as analternative to histochemical methods. Since databases like TCGAprovide easy and unrestricted access to gene expression data forhundreds of patients, the challenge is to extract a minimaloptimal set of genes with good prognostic properties from a largebulk of genes making a moderate contribution to classification.Several studies have successfully applied machine learningalgorithms to solve this so-called gene selection problem.However, more diverse data from other OMICS technologies areavailable, including methylation. We hypothesize that combiningmethylation and gene expression data could already lead to alargely improved classification model, since the resulting modelwill reflect differences not only on the transcriptomic, but alsoon an epigenetic level. We compared so-called random forestderived classification models based on gene expression andmethylation data alone, to a model based on the combined featuresand to a model based on the gold standard PAM50. We obtainedbootstrap errors of 10-20% and classification error of 1-50%,depending on breast cancer subtype and model. The gene expressionmodel was clearly superior to the methylation model, which wasalso reflected in the combined model, which mainly selectedfeatures from gene expression data. However, the methylationmodel was able to identify unique features not considered asrelevant by the gene expression model, which might provide deeperinsights into breast cancer subtype differentiation on anepigenetic level.","tags":["cancer subtyping","multi-omics integration","biomarker discovery"],"title":"Classification of Breast Cancer Subtypes by combining GeneExpression and DNA Methylation Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlene Lemvig Pedersen","Ines Block","Markus List","Helle Christiansen","Steffen Schmidt","Jan Mollenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"e3b74b5f600cd5cb485cd42761f05848","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/pedersen-2014-integrated/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pedersen-2014-integrated/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Integrated Automation of High-Throughput Screening and Reverse Phase Protein Array Sample Preparation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlene Lemvig Pedersen","Ines Block","Markus List","Leena Karimi","Helle Christiansen","Steffen Schmidt","Jan Mollenhauer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388530800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388530800,"objectID":"6d301ada913c8670db9a886d543d16c6","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/publication/pedersen-2014-reverse/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pedersen-2014-reverse/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reverse Phase Protein Arrays for High-Throughput Protein Measurements in Mammospheres","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1348853998,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1348853998,"objectID":"91bfdd42377d349e4e37efe560fb6c8b","permalink":"https://biomedical-big-data.de/tool/openlabframework/","publishdate":"2012-09-28T19:39:58+02:00","relpermalink":"/tool/openlabframework/","section":"tool","summary":"A laboratory information management system for functional genomics.","tags":["LIMS","high-throughput screening"],"title":"OpenLabFramework","type":"tool"}]
