  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Standard therapeutic protocols for glioblastoma, the
              most aggressive type of brain cancer, include surgery followed by
              chemoradiotherapy. Additionally, carmustine-eluting wafers can be
              implanted locally into the resection cavity. OBJECTIVE: To
              evaluate microRNA (miRNA)-181d as a prognostic marker of
              responses to carmustine wafer implantation. METHODS: A total of
              80 glioblastoma patients (40/group) were included in a matched
              pair analysis. One group (carmustine wafer group) received
              concomitant chemoradiotherapy with carmustine wafer implantation
              (Stupp protocol). The second group (control group) received only
              concomitant chemoradiotherapy. All tumor specimens were subjected
              to evaluations of miRNA-181d expression, results were correlated
              with further individual clinical data. The Cancer Genome Atlas
              (TCGA) dataset of 149 patients was used as an independent cohort
              to validate the results. RESULTS: Patients in the carmustine
              wafer group with low miRNA-181d expression had significantly
              longer overall (hazard ratio [HR], 35.03, [95\% confidence
              interval (CI): 3.50-350.23], P = .002) and progression-free
              survival (HR, 20.23, [95\% CI: 2.19-186.86], P = .008) than
              patients of the same group with a high miRNA-181d expression.
              These correlations were not observed in the control group. The
              nonsignificance in the control group was confirmed in the
              independent TCGA dataset. The carmustine wafer group patients
              with low miRNA-181d expression also had a significantly longer
              progression-free (P = .049) and overall survival (OS) (P = .034),
              compared with control group patients. Gross total resection
              correlated significantly with longer OS (P = .023). CONCLUSION:
              MiRNA-181d expression significantly affects treatment responses

               (GTEx) project, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or the

               a wealth of genomic datasets with the goal of advancing our
               understanding of cell differentiation and disease mechanisms.
               However, utilizing all of these data effectively through
               integrative analysis is hampered by batch effects, large cell
               type heterogeneity and low replicate numbers. To study if batch
               effects across datasets can be observed and adjusted for, we
               analyze RNA-seq data of 215 samples from ENCODE, Roadmap,
               BLUEPRINT and DEEP as well as 1336 samples from GTEx and TCGA.
               While batch effects are a considerable issue, it is non-trivial
               to determine if batch adjustment leads to an improvement in data
               quality, especially in cases of low replicate numbers.We present
               a novel method for assessing the performance of batch effect
               adjustment methods on heterogeneous data. Our method borrows
               information from the Cell Ontology to establish if batch
               adjustment leads to a better agreement between observed pairwise
               similarity and similarity of cell types inferred from the
               ontology. A comparison of state-of-the art batch effect
               adjustment methods suggests that batch effects in heterogeneous
               datasets with low replicate numbers cannot be adequately
               adjusted. Better methods need to be developed, which can be
               assessed objectively in the framework presented here.Our method

  abstract = "Motivation: Genome-wide measurements of paired miRNA and gene
              expression data have enabled the prediction of competing
              endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). It has been shown hat the sponge effect
              mediated by protein-coding as well as non-coding ceRNAs can play
              an important regulatory role in the cell in health and disease.
              Therefore many computational methods for the computational
              identification of ceRNAs have been suggested. In particular
              methods based on Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) have shown
              promising results. However, the currently available
              implementation is slow and cannot be used to perform computations
              on a large scale. Results: Here we present JAMI, a Java tool that
              uses a non-parametric estimator for CMI values from gene and
              miRNA expression data. We show that JAMI speeds up the
              computation of ceRNA networks by a factor of âˆ¼70 compared to
              currently available implementations. Further, JAMI supports
              multi-threading to make use of common multi-core architectures
              for further performance gain. Requirements: Java 8. Availability:

  abstract = "Docker virtualization allows for software tools to be executed in
              an isolated and controlled environment referred to as a

              exactly as intended by the developer and, consequently, they
              simplify the distribution of scientific software and foster
              reproducible research. The Docker paradigm is that each container
              encapsulates one particular software tool. However, to analyze
              complex biomedical data sets, it is often necessary to combine
              several software tools into elaborate workflows. To address this
              challenge, several Docker containers need to be instantiated and
              properly integrated, which complicates the software deployment

              Docker, Docker compose, can be used to mitigate these problems by
              providing a unified setup routine that deploys several tools in
              an integrated fashion. We demonstrate the power of this approach

  abstract = "Massive amounts of 16S rRNA sequencing data have been stored in
              publicly accessible databases, such as GOLD, SILVA, GreenGenes
              (GG), and the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP). Many of these
              sequences are tagged with geo-locations. Nevertheless,
              researchers currently lack a user-friendly tool to analyze
              microbial distribution in a location-specific context. BioAtlas
              is an interactive web application that closes this gap between
              sequence databases, taxonomy profiling and geo/body-location
              information. It enables users to browse taxonomically annotated
              sequences across (i) the world map, (ii) human body maps and
              (iii) user-defined maps. It further allows for (iv) uploading of
              own sample data, which can be placed on existing maps to (v)
              browse the distribution of the associated taxonomies. Finally,
              BioAtlas enables users to (vi) contribute custom maps (e.g. for
              plants or animals) and to map taxonomies to pre-defined map
              locations. In summary, BioAtlas facilitates map-supported
              browsing of public 16S rRNA sequence data and analyses of
              user-provided sequences without requiring manual mapping to
              taxonomies and existing databases. AVAILABILITY:

               patients suffering from complex diseases, such as cancer.
               However, prediction models built upon single-gene (SG) features
               show poor stability and performance on independent datasets.
               Attempts to mitigate these drawbacks have led to the development
               of network-based approaches that integrate pathway information
               to produce meta-gene (MG) features. Also, MG approaches have
               only dealt with the two-class problem of good versus poor
               outcome prediction. Stratifying patients based on their
               molecular subtypes can provide a detailed view of the disease
               and lead to more personalized therapies. We propose and discuss
               a novel MG approach based on de novo pathways, which for the
               first time have been used as features in a multi-class setting
               to predict cancer subtypes. Comprehensive evaluation in a large
               cohort of breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas

               models, while also providing valuable insight into the cancer
               hallmarks that drive them. In addition, when tested on an
               independent benchmark non-TCGA dataset, MG features consistently
               outperformed SG models. We provide an easy-to-use web service at
               http://pathclass.compbio.sdu.dk where users can upload their own

              features from gene expression data. However, the methylation
              model was able to identify unique features not considered as
              relevant by the gene expression model, which might provide deeper

  abstract = "Electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) are more accessible and
              reliable than their paper based alternatives and thus find
              widespread adoption. While a large number of commercial products
              is available, small- to mid-sized laboratories can often not
              afford the costs or are concerned about the longevity of the
              providers. Turning towards free alternatives, however, raises
              questions about data protection, which are not sufficiently
              addressed by available solutions. To serve as legal documents,
              ELNs must prevent scientific fraud through technical means such
              as digital signatures. It would also be advantageous if an ELN
              was integrated with a laboratory information management system to
              allow for a comprehensive documentation of experimental work
              including the location of samples that were used in a particular
              experiment. Here, we present OpenLabNotes, which adds
              state-of-the-art ELN capabilities to OpenLabFramework, a powerful
              and flexible laboratory information management system. In
              contrast to comparable solutions, it allows to protect the
              intellectual property of its users by offering data protection
              with digital signatures. OpenLabNotes effectively closes the gap
              between research documentation and sample management, thus making
              Open-LabFramework more attractive for laboratories that seek to
              increase productivity through electronic data management.",
