              most aggressive type of brain cancer, include surgery followed by
              chemoradiotherapy. Additionally, carmustine-eluting wafers can be
              implanted locally into the resection cavity. OBJECTIVE: To
              evaluate microRNA (miRNA)-181d as a prognostic marker of
              responses to carmustine wafer implantation. METHODS: A total of
              80 glioblastoma patients (40/group) were included in a matched
              pair analysis. One group (carmustine wafer group) received
              concomitant chemoradiotherapy with carmustine wafer implantation
              (Stupp protocol). The second group (control group) received only
              concomitant chemoradiotherapy. All tumor specimens were subjected
              to evaluations of miRNA-181d expression, results were correlated
              with further individual clinical data. The Cancer Genome Atlas
              (TCGA) dataset of 149 patients was used as an independent cohort
              to validate the results. RESULTS: Patients in the carmustine
              wafer group with low miRNA-181d expression had significantly
              longer overall (hazard ratio [HR], 35.03, [95\% confidence
              interval (CI): 3.50-350.23], P = .002) and progression-free
              survival (HR, 20.23, [95\% CI: 2.19-186.86], P = .008) than
              patients of the same group with a high miRNA-181d expression.
              These correlations were not observed in the control group. The
              nonsignificance in the control group was confirmed in the
              independent TCGA dataset. The carmustine wafer group patients
              with low miRNA-181d expression also had a significantly longer
              progression-free (P = .049) and overall survival (OS) (P = .034),
              compared with control group patients. Gross total resection

               a wealth of genomic datasets with the goal of advancing our
               understanding of cell differentiation and disease mechanisms.
               However, utilizing all of these data effectively through
               integrative analysis is hampered by batch effects, large cell
               type heterogeneity and low replicate numbers. To study if batch
               effects across datasets can be observed and adjusted for, we
               analyze RNA-seq data of 215 samples from ENCODE, Roadmap,
               BLUEPRINT and DEEP as well as 1336 samples from GTEx and TCGA.
               While batch effects are a considerable issue, it is non-trivial
               to determine if batch adjustment leads to an improvement in data
               quality, especially in cases of low replicate numbers.We present

  abstract = "Motivation: Genome-wide measurements of paired miRNA and gene
              expression data have enabled the prediction of competing
              endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). It has been shown hat the sponge effect
              mediated by protein-coding as well as non-coding ceRNAs can play
              an important regulatory role in the cell in health and disease.
              Therefore many computational methods for the computational
              identification of ceRNAs have been suggested. In particular
              methods based on Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) have shown
              promising results. However, the currently available
              implementation is slow and cannot be used to perform computations
              on a large scale. Results: Here we present JAMI, a Java tool that
              uses a non-parametric estimator for CMI values from gene and
              miRNA expression data. We show that JAMI speeds up the
              computation of ceRNA networks by a factor of ∼70 compared to
              currently available implementations. Further, JAMI supports
              multi-threading to make use of common multi-core architectures
              for further performance gain. Requirements: Java 8. Availability:

              simplify the distribution of scientific software and foster

              (iii) user-defined maps. It further allows for (iv) uploading of

               However, prediction models built upon single-gene (SG) features
               show poor stability and performance on independent datasets.
               Attempts to mitigate these drawbacks have led to the development
               of network-based approaches that integrate pathway information
               to produce meta-gene (MG) features. Also, MG approaches have
               only dealt with the two-class problem of good versus poor
               outcome prediction. Stratifying patients based on their
               molecular subtypes can provide a detailed view of the disease
               and lead to more personalized therapies. We propose and discuss
               a novel MG approach based on de novo pathways, which for the
               first time have been used as features in a multi-class setting

               independent benchmark non-TCGA dataset, MG features consistently

              years, gene expression profiling has been investigated as an
              alternative to histochemical methods. Since databases like TCGA
              provide easy and unrestricted access to gene expression data for
              hundreds of patients, the challenge is to extract a minimal
              optimal set of genes with good prognostic properties from a large
              bulk of genes making a moderate contribution to classification.
              Several studies have successfully applied machine learning
              algorithms to solve this so-called gene selection problem.
              However, more diverse data from other OMICS technologies are
              available, including methylation. We hypothesize that combining
              methylation and gene expression data could already lead to a
              largely improved classification model, since the resulting model
              will reflect differences not only on the transcriptomic, but also
              on an epigenetic level. We compared so-called random forest
              derived classification models based on gene expression and
              methylation data alone, to a model based on the combined features
              and to a model based on the gold standard PAM50. We obtained
              bootstrap errors of 10-20\% and classification error of 1-50\%,
              depending on breast cancer subtype and model. The gene expression
              model was clearly superior to the methylation model, which was
              also reflected in the combined model, which mainly selected
              features from gene expression data. However, the methylation
              model was able to identify unique features not considered as
              relevant by the gene expression model, which might provide deeper

              years, gene expression profiling has been investigated as an
              alternative to histochemical methods. Since databases like TCGA
              provide easy and unrestricted access to gene expression data for
              hundreds of patients, the challenge is to extract a minimal
              optimal set of genes with good prognostic properties from a large
              bulk of genes making a moderate contribution to classification.
              Several studies have successfully applied machine learning
              algorithms to solve this so-called gene selection problem.
              However, more diverse data from other OMICS technologies are
              available, including methylation. We hypothesize that combining
              methylation and gene expression data could already lead to a
              largely improved classification model, since the resulting model
              will reflect differences not only on the transcriptomic, but also
              on an epigenetic level. We compared so-called random forest
              derived classification models based on gene expression and
              methylation data alone, to a model based on the combined features
              and to a model based on the gold standard PAM50. We obtained
              bootstrap errors of 10-20\% and classification error of 1-50\%,
              depending on breast cancer subtype and model. The gene expression
              model was clearly superior to the methylation model, which was
              also reflected in the combined model, which mainly selected
              features from gene expression data. However, the methylation
              model was able to identify unique features not considered as
              relevant by the gene expression model, which might provide deeper
              insights into breast cancer subtype differentiation on an
              epigenetic level.",

  abstract = "Electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) are more accessible and
              reliable than their paper based alternatives and thus find
              widespread adoption. While a large number of commercial products
              is available, small- to mid-sized laboratories can often not
              afford the costs or are concerned about the longevity of the
              providers. Turning towards free alternatives, however, raises
              questions about data protection, which are not sufficiently
              addressed by available solutions. To serve as legal documents,
              ELNs must prevent scientific fraud through technical means such
              as digital signatures. It would also be advantageous if an ELN
              was integrated with a laboratory information management system to
              allow for a comprehensive documentation of experimental work
              including the location of samples that were used in a particular
              experiment. Here, we present OpenLabNotes, which adds
              state-of-the-art ELN capabilities to OpenLabFramework, a powerful
              and flexible laboratory information management system. In
              contrast to comparable solutions, it allows to protect the
              intellectual property of its users by offering data protection
              with digital signatures. OpenLabNotes effectively closes the gap
              between research documentation and sample management, thus making
              Open-LabFramework more attractive for laboratories that seek to
              increase productivity through electronic data management.",
